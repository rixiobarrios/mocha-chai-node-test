# Testing for Mocha and Chai using NodeJS

**What is Mocha framework**  
Mocha is a feature-rich JavaScript testing framework and one of the simplest suites for Node.js test cases available. It is designed for unit testing and integration testing, and supports both Test Driven Development (TDD) and Behavior Driven Development. Contrary to other frameworks, such as Jasmine or Jest, this test suite allows for flexible and accurate reporting, asynchronous testing, test coverage reports and can use any assertion library.

**What is Chai library**  
Chai is a behavior and test-driven development library that which works perfectly well with Mocha – and Jasmine – frameworks. It allows you to make assertions about values, types, and behaviors in your tests, helping you verify the expected outcomes of your code.

**Configuring unit tests with Mocha and Chai**  
Every application requires testing before the deployment to the server, especially a welcome site that determines the first impression. In this test case, we shall use Mocha as the test running framework, and Chai as the assertion library to apply unit testing to our application.
